# The Haptic PTSD Project

The Haptic PTSD Project is an Android application designed to assist individuals struggling with PTSD and sleep quality issues. By leveraging the physical capabilities of modern smartphones, the app provides non-invasive support through tactile feedback and motion sensing.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to improve sleep quality and provide relief from PTSD symptoms using:
- **Haptic Feedback:** Utilizing the cellphone's vibration motor to provide grounding and calming sensations.
- **Gyroscope Sensor:** Monitoring movement and orientation to interact with the user or track sleep patterns.

## Features (Planned/Current)

- **Sleep Assistance:** Specialized haptic patterns designed to aid in falling asleep and staying asleep.
- **Grounding Techniques:** Immediate haptic response to help users during episodes of high anxiety or PTSD triggers.
- **Sensor Integration:** Intelligent use of the gyroscope to detect and respond to user movement during rest.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Platform:** Android
- **Hardware Integration:** Android Haptics (VibratorManager) and Sensor API (Gyroscope)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run on a physical Android device to experience the haptic feedback.
